An alien lives on planet Zigmoid which is named after the aliens which are
called zigs. They used  to live on a bigger  planet called Zappa which had
strong gravity which made their feet hurt. For this reason they wore shoes on
all their feet.  But on this new planet, they don't feel as much pain and so
only wear shoes on every other pair of legs. This saves each of them from
having to buy four extra shoes. Each Zig has 3 toes on each foot. How many toes
does a zig have in total?
